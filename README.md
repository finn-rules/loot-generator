# Project: Loot Generator

Authors: Finn Rowles

## Resources

*   Project 3 (speedreader) for understanding scanners, hasNext methods, and "Generators" for data structures. 
*   Oracle Libraries for Scanners, Strings, Lists, HashMaps, and Files for methods used that are not my own.
*   Oracle Libraries for Integers, TreeMaps, ArrayLists for methods that are not my own.
*   Professor Osera in class and on quizzes for the inspiration for my Pair class. 
*   Professor Osera at office hours to ask about testing and approaches.
*   MVN and Visual Studio Code
*   Java Version 17.0.4
*   Although I did not ask any peers for approach ideas, I explained some of my approaches/data structures in the project to Emily L and Owen B. (recursion on treasureclass, randomness, trees vs arraylists)

## Revision Log

*   4/9 : Planned possible classes/approaches to the project.
*   4/10 : Created classes Pair, MonsterInfoGenerator, TreasureTreeGenerator, LootStatTreeGenerator, and implemented
    their data structures. Created some methods in LootGenerator.java: pickMonster, pickLoot
*   4/11 : Finished up the LootStatTreeGenerator class and fleshed out method pickStat. 
           Finished the project and wrote all of the necessary methods in main. Tested and troubleshot.
           Went to Osera's office hours to ask about testing and if my approach was valid.
*  4/18 : Javadocs and tested on a UNIX device. Now passes with 0 checkstyle violations.
